# Sales Performance and Customer Segmentation Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes sales performance and customer purchasing behavior for **ShopEase**, a multi-province retail company.  
The goal is to help leadership understand key drivers of revenue growth, identify top-performing products and regions, and develop customer segmentation strategies to improve sales and retention.

## 📂 Data Sources
The analysis was conducted using three primary datasets:
- **Sales Table** – transaction-level details (SaleID, ProductID, SaleDate, Quantity, Price, CustomerID).
- **Product Table** – product metadata (ProductID, ProductName, UnitPrice, Category).
- **Customer Table** – customer demographics (CustomerID, Province).

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Power BI Desktop** – for dashboard creation and visual storytelling.  
- **Python** – for initial data wrangling and cleaning and segmentation analysis.  

## 🔑 Key Tasks
1. **Data Wrangling**
   - Joined Sales, Product, and Customer tables to create a unified dataset (unique at CustomerID).  
   - Addressed missing values and removed duplicates for data integrity.  

2. **Insights Generated**
   - Top 5 products by total sales revenue.  
   - Top 3 provinces contributing most to overall revenue.  
   - Average revenue per customer by province.  
   - Highest-revenue product category in each province.
